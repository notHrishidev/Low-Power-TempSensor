# Low-Power-TempSensor

Designed and simulated a temperature sensoing system using an LM-35 temperature sensor connected to an ATmega 328p microcontroller which reads and displays the temperature to an LCD display every 8 seconds (Scalable to higher intervals) and enters power down-mode when idle. It enables the sensor to be used in power constrained environments. This project helped in getting familiar with designing and programming microcontrollers with Embedded C and referring to their datasheets for gathering information.
